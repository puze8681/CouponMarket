  static const String phText = '''
pH measures how acidic or alkaline your water is. If water is too acidic, it can corrode pipes and appliances, while overly alkaline water may taste bitter or unpleasant.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends an ideal pH range of 6.5 to 8.5 for drinking water. Within this range, water is not only pleasant to drink but also helps protect plumbing and household appliances from damage.

Imbalanced pH levels can result from issues such as old plumbing, groundwater contamination, or improper water treatment. For instance, if your coffee tastes metallic or your plumbing deteriorates quickly, your water's pH may fall outside the ideal range.

Maintaining the proper pH offers several benefits:

Better Taste: Ensures water tastes fresh and neutral.
Protection for Appliances: Reduces corrosion, prolonging the lifespan of pipes and equipment.
Enhanced Safety: Minimizes microbial growth and supports safe water usage.
Both the EPA and the World Health Organization (WHO) emphasize pH as a critical factor in water quality. Monitoring pH ensures safe, pleasant, and reliable water for daily use.

  static const String hardnessText = '''
Hardness refers to the concentration of minerals like calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) in water. High hardness levels can lead to several issues:

Limescale: Formation of mineral deposits in pipes, sinks, and bathtubs.
Reduced Soap Efficiency: Hard water combines with soap, reducing lather and cleaning effectiveness.
Appliance Damage: Build-up of scale in devices like washing machines and dishwashers, reducing their lifespan.
However, calcium and magnesium are essential minerals for the human body and can be beneficial in moderate amounts. Water hardness varies based on the mineral content of the source (e.g., groundwater, lakes) and factors such as aging plumbing systems.

Hardness Classification (mg/L)
0–60 mg/L: Soft water
61–120 mg/L: Moderately hard water
121–180 mg/L: Hard water
>180 mg/L: Very hard water
For example, if you notice white spots on dishes or stiff laundry after washing, your water may fall into the hard water category.

Importance of Managing Hardness
Health: Provides essential minerals but may pose challenges if excessively hard.
Efficiency: Optimal hardness levels protect plumbing and appliances from damage.
Water Quality Management: Adjusting hardness through water treatment systems minimizes inconvenience for household water use.

  static const String totalAlkalinityText = '''
Alkalinity measures water’s ability to resist changes in pH, helping to prevent corrosion and ensuring water remains stable. The ideal range for alkalinity is 80–120 mg/L. If you notice rust on faucets or skin irritation after a shower, the water may lack sufficient alkalinity.

When alkalinity is too high, the water can have an unpleasant taste, and when too low, the pH can fluctuate drastically. The WHO recommends a range of 20–200 mg/L for alkalinity. Proper alkalinity stabilizes the pH of water and improves its quality, but issues can arise in older tanks or inefficient water treatment systems.

  static const String sodiumChlorideText = '''
Sodium is a vital mineral that helps maintain the balance of fluids in the body. However, high sodium levels can be harmful, particularly for people who need a low-sodium diet. While small amounts of sodium are necessary for health, excessive sodium—especially from sources like salt-heavy kitchens or inadequate water treatment systems—can lead to health issues such as high blood pressure. Sodium can enter water through natural sources or water softening devices. When the concentration exceeds 200 mg/L, it can cause a salty taste and exacerbate health problems. If your water tastes salty, it may be helpful to test for sodium levels.

  static const String leadText = '''
Lead is highly toxic, even in small amounts, and particularly harmful to the neurological development of children. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that lead levels in drinking water should be below 0.01 mg/L. Lead contamination often comes from old lead pipes or kitchenware containing lead. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets the action level at 0.015 mg/L, but no level of lead is considered safe. If your home has old plumbing, it’s crucial to have a lead test performed to ensure your water’s safety.

  static const String ironText = '''
Iron is an essential mineral for transporting oxygen in the body, but high levels of iron in water can cause metallic taste, unpleasant odors, and stains on laundry or plumbing. Iron contamination often arises from old iron pipes or naturally occurring iron in groundwater. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommends an iron concentration of no more than 0.3 mg/L to avoid these issues. If your water has a metallic taste or shows discoloration, it may indicate high iron levels.

  static const String copperText = '''
Copper is essential in small amounts for the proper functioning of the nervous and immune systems. However, excessive copper can cause gastrointestinal issues and, over time, lead to chronic damage to the liver and kidneys. Copper contamination can occur from corroded copper pipes or improper maintenance of water filtration systems. When copper pipes corrode, copper may leach into the water. While small amounts of copper are safe, levels above 1.3 mg/L (as per U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines) can cause stomach upset and long-term damage to organs. If your water has a metallic taste or shows a bluish-green color, the copper concentration may be high.
